    <h2>First Post: The Corruption Within CYFD</h2>
    <p>Posted on September 30, 2024</p>
    <p>The Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) is supposed to protect children and ensure their well-being. Unfortunately, many families, including mine, have experienced the opposite. CYFD has a history of taking children's belongings without just cause, and rather than placing children in safe homes, some end up in abusive environments. My family and I have personally faced these challenges, and through this blog, I aim to expose the corruption within CYFD and advocate for change to protect our children.</p>
